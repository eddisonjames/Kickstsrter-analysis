# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Inspired by the success of the fundraising goal of her play Fever, Louise is interested in knowing the level of contribution other
campaigns receive in relation to their launch data and funding goals. Hence, the purpose of the project is to analyze campaign outcomes
in relation to launch dates and funding goals. This will be achieved through the use of visualizations, that includes graphs and charts.
The first deliverable is outcomes based on launch date, while the second deliverable is outcome based on goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyze campaign outcomes in relation to launch dates and funding goals. This will be achieved through
the use of visualizations, that includes graphs and charts.The first deliverable is outcomes based on launch date, while the second 
deliverable is outcome based on goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data in the month, day and year format was first obtained using this code: =(((I2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1). The year () function was
used to get the year for the deadline date and launch date by using =YEAR(S2). The pivot table was then created with months as the row labels
and the column labels were successful, failed and canceled. A line graph was then created to represent the data in the pivot table. 
In Deliverable 2, for the Outcome Based on Goals Chart, the COUNTIFS() function was used to count the number of instances of successful, failed
and canceled plays for the given goals ranges. An example of the COUNTIFS() function is: 
=COUNTIFS(Sheet1!$F$522:Sheet1!$F$4115,"=successful",Sheet1!$D$522:Sheet1!$D$4115,"<=24999", Sheet1!$D$522:Sheet1!$D$4115,">=20000")

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the Theater Outcomes by launch date, each month showed there are consistently more successful than failed outcomes, and the failed outcomes are
significantly higher than cancelled outcomes. The higher successful and failed outcomes occurred during the months from April to August, with a decrease
in September and another spike in October, while the cancelled outcomes were consistently less than 10 with zero cancelled outcome in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For goals amount less than $1500, the percentage of successful is greater than the percentage of failed plays.From $20000 to $40000 the percentage of 
failed is greater than the percentage of successful. Then there is a brieft period around $40000, where there are more successful plays that failed plays.
The number of successful plays quickly decreased for more than $50000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One significant was COUNTIFS() function.My graphs look slightly different than the model howevr, I have double checked my functions and there do not seem to 
be any errors.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
For the Theater Outcomes by launch date, each month showed there are consistently more successful than failed outcomes, and the failed outcomes are
significantly higher than cancelled outcomes. The higher successful and failed outcomes occurred during the months from April to August, with a decrease
in September and another spike in October, while the cancelled outcomes were consistently less than 10 with zero cancelled outcome in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
For the Theater Outcomes by launch date, each month showed there are consistently more successful than failed outcomes, and the failed outcomes are
significantly higher than cancelled outcomes. The higher successful and failed outcomes occurred during the months from April to August, with a 
decrease in September and another spike in October, while the cancelled outcomes were consistently less than 10 with zero cancelled outcome in October.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations to the dataset are who is the production manager or the production company of the theater. A well-regarded production manager or 
production company that have previously produced successful plays may find people are more willing to invest to future theater productions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible tables and/or graphs we could create are graph the time-period between the deadline and the launch date for successful, failed and cancelled 
productions to decipher if ample time was devoted to raising the necessary funds. A circle graph can also tell us what category and subcategory is successful, 
failed or cancelled.
